# WeatherApp

## Overview
WeatherApp is a simple web application that allows users to check the current weather conditions for any city around the world. Users can enter a city name or use their geolocation to get weather information. The application fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a user-friendly format.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML document that contains the structure of the web page, including a header, a search form for city input, and a section to display weather information.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet that defines the layout, colors, fonts, and responsive design elements for the application.
- `javascript.js`: The JavaScript file that handles fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, displaying weather information, and managing user interactions.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd WeatherApp
   ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file** in your web browser to view the application.

3. **API Key**: Make sure to replace the placeholder API key in `javascript.js` with your own OpenWeatherMap API key to fetch weather data.

## Usage
- Enter a city name in the search input and click the "Get Weather" button to retrieve the current weather information for that city.
- Alternatively, click the "Use My Location" button to get the weather information based on your current geographical location.
